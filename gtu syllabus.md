**List of Practical:** 

**Consider dataset with student name, gender, Enrollmentno, 4 semester result with marks of each subject, his mobile number, city. Implement following in Python or R.** 

1. Perform descriptive analysis and identify the data type. 
1. Implement a method to find out variation in data. For example the difference between highest and lowest marks in each subject semester wise. 
1. Plot the graph showing result of student in each semester. 
1. Plot the graph showing the geographical location of students. 
1. Plot the graph showing number of male and female students. 
1. Implement a method to treat missing value for gender and missing value for marks. 
1. Implement linear regression to predict the 5th semester result of student. 
1. Implement logistic regression and decision tree to classify the student as average or clever.
